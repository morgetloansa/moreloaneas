It has been a phenomenon that has risen at an astronomic rate and that now involves billions of Pounds and millions of users. This is the financial product that is the payday loan and the online cash loan. Many people all over the United Kingdom are looking away from the more conventional providers of credit and are going in ever greater numbers to this new form of credit provider. The primary questions are, why are people turning away from banks and credit cards, and what has led to the popularity of payday loan companies?

There are some interesting answers to the latter point here. We saw a leading provider of payday loan services advertise on the shirts of Blackpool Football club in the 2010-2011 football season when they were playing in the English Premier League. More recently we have this same business organisation sponsoring none other than Premier League giant Newcastle United Football Club. This must have fundamentally changed the perception of these companies in the very psyche of the British public. In previous years it was only a marginal demographic of society, low income earners, people on benefits and people who could not manage their finances properly, that were perceived as users of these loans. With this notable advertising at these popular football clubs and the massive fan bases of supporters that now are being exposed to these brands, it is no surprise their popularity has grown.
